\tableofcontents

\section{What is the current status?}
\subsection{What has been done?}
Learn how to build a quantum circuit. Map out the workflow that takes you through the execution of a quantum code.

\subsection{What has been partially done?}
Comparison of quantum and classical programming. Format the references correctly. 

\subsection{What has not been done yet and why?}
Benchmarking has not been done and will probably be abandoned. 

\section{What is your plan to complete the term paper?}
\subsection{What are the steps for completing the term paper?}
Complete writing the examples. Add a comparison of classical and quantum computing. 

\subsection{What is the timeline?}
Week of April 10: Draft a comparison of digital computation and quantum computing. \\
Week of April 17: Complete references. \\
Week of April 24: Revise the paper and slides. \\

\subsection{What is the plan B?}
No plan B

\section{What are the constraints or limitations you are currently facing in finishing up the term paper?}
\subsection{What are the resources you are still looking for?}
None
\subsection{What are the problems you are not sure whether solutions can be found in 2 to 3 weeks?}
Create a coherent explanation of the similarities and differences between quantum computation. 

\subsection{What are the assumptions for the conclusions you made in your term paper?}
Current software engineers will need a way to anchor their understandings of quantum computing using classical computing.
