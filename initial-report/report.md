# Programming quantum computers

## Introduction

Quantum computing is here -- you can buy time on a quantum computer today. How can you know what to buy? What does a quantum computer do? How can it do something better than a classical computer? 

## Background

Here are all the things you should already know about quantum computers.


## Preliminary research findings or results

My claim is that these are cool things to know now about qc

## Charts or tables

## Preliminary conclusions

### Comparison of quantum to digital computing methods

Multiple measurements vs algorithms with deterministic outcomes. In the case of quantum computing often the same circuit will be evaluated thousands of times to build up a confidence in one measurement or a distribution of measurements. 

#### Languages
QASM is the basic assembly level intermediate representation for quantum code. It allows us to create two types of registries: quantum registries and classical registries. The quantum registries hold the information in qubits while the classical registries hold information in bits. Higher level languages use python libraries to represent the different parts of the quantum program.

Pure quantum computing: superposition and entanglement

Operations | Classical | Quantum
-----------|-----------|-------
Identity   |   yes     | yes
Negation   |   yes     | yes
Set 0      |   yes     | no
Set 1      |   yes     | no

Dealing with data -- very small number of classical bits: problems have to be broken into small pieces with quantum parts

Requirement for a hybrid approach. 

Classical computing types: char, int, float, string, dict, list.

Quantum data types are limited to qubits and the classical bits they are measured into

Fundamental qubit operations: rotations, reversible


Fundamental bit operations: identity, negation, set 0, set 1





### Benchmarking and error rates

#### Classical Benchmarks
FLOPS, cycles per second, graphical rendering, hash calculations

#### Quantum Benchmarks

- Issues with different hardware
- How much does a gate act like we suspect?
