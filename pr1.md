- Publisher: Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Post Moores Era Supercomputing
- Date: Nov 2017
- Pages: 7
- Relevance: 
Explanation of some physical benchmarks for quantum computers. We would use this as a physical basis for the computational benchmarks we build.

### 5
- Title: Open Quantum Assembly Language
- Author(s): Andrew W. Cross, Lev S. Bishop, John A. Smolin, Jay M. Gambetta
- Publisher: arXiv
- Date: 7/11/2017
- Pages: 24
- Relevance:
This is the most referenced paper on quantum assembly -- a language that gives us access to the basic quantum gates. It looks like C and will be how we program some benchmarks, or at least the basis of a framework we use to program our benchmarks.

- Title: Overview and Comparison of Gate Level Quantum Software Platforms
- Author(s): Ryan LaRose
- Publisher: Quantum Journal
- Date: 	2019-03-25
- Pages: 24
- Relevance: 
This is an overview of several quantum programming frameworks and how they offer abstractions to gate level assemblers.


## Thesis


### 1

- Title: A study of the performance of D-Wave quantum computers using spanning trees
- Author(s): John Spencer Hall
- Publisher: MS, Mississippi State University
- Date: May 2018
- Pages: 89
- Relevance
Thesis is an example of a method of benchmarking a particular piece of quantum hardware. This is basically what I want to do with a different quantum computer and different benchmarking method

### 2 

- Title: Quantum Circuit Synthesis using Group Decomposition and Hilbert Spaces
- Author(s): Michael S. Saraivanov
- Publisher: MS, Portland State University
- Date: 2013
- Pages: 165
- Relevance
Quantum computing is currently at the gate level -- when classical computing was at the level of ands, ors, nots etc. This thesis is a comprehensive overview of all the quantum operations that could be available to a quantum computer.

# Problem Statement

Quantum hardware is starting to become available to business users. There are many quantum algorithms available. The goal of this project is to research and perform a benchmark on a quantum computing simulator and hopefully on real quantum hardware.
